- **Llama2(LLM)**: Provides AI-powered responses based on user input.
- **Langchain(LLM framework)**: Facilitates the integration of language models for better response generation.
- **Pinecone(Vector Store)**: Manages and stores vectors to enable semantic search for medical information.
- **Medical resource(Knowledge base)**:[The GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA of MEDICINE](https://www.academia.edu/32752835/The_GALE_ENCYCLOPEDIA_of_MEDICINE_SECOND_EDITION)
